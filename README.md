# Business Analytics Nanodegree Projects

## Overview
This repository contains my projects for Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree Program. The program focuses on developing foundational data skills applicable across various functions and industries. Through this program, I gained proficiency in analyzing data using Excel, querying databases using SQL, and building interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau. The main objectives of this nanodegree are to gain foundational data skills applicable to any industry, collect and analyze data, model business scenarios, and effectively communicate findings using SQL, Excel, and Tableau.

## Projects

### Project 1: Tableau Dashboard Exploration
#### Description
In this project, I explored a Tableau dashboard to enhance my data interpretation and communication skills. The dashboard provided visualizations related to malaria in Africa, and I identified three insights from the visualizations provided. These insights were then explained concisely in a report along with corresponding screen capture images.
